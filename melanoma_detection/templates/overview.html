<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Our website is designed to help people easily diagnose moles or other skin lesions as malignant (indicative of skin cancer) without going to the doctor. People can simply take a picture of the mole or lesion, upload the picture at this site, provide some additional optional information, and receive a probabilistic prediction of whether or not the mole or lesion is malignant.</p>

<p>To better assist with our model prediction, we ask for the sex and age of the affected person. We will never store or share this information; nor will we use it for any purposes other than predicting whether the person may have skin cancer. That being said, we understand that some people may not be comfortable sharing this information. Therefore, it is an optional input. If you do not wish to share the information, the resulting prediction may be less accurate.</p>

<p>Our model was trained with the <a href="https://challenge2020.isic-archive.com/">SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification dataset</a>. Unfortunately, this dataset predominantly contains moles and lesions from people with light-colored skin. There is currently no good source of data available to train such a model for people who are not of light-colored skin. If you are not of light-colored skin, we do not recommend relying on the predictions generated by our model.</p>
