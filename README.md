# melanoma-detection

The aim of this repo is to create a website where users can upload pictures of moles, along with optional information about the person, like age and sex, to receive some predicted probability that the person to whom the moles belong has melanoma.

We want the website to be fast and easy to use, so that people are inclined to use it. A convenient, accurate service would aid greatly in the early detection of melanoma, which is one of the best ways to combat the cancer.

To return a predicted probability, we will use a neural network trained on the [ISIC 2020 Challenge Dataset](https://challenge2020.isic-archive.com/).
